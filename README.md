# VIM - The Archlinux Build
Vim feels like it requires one to have a degree in VimScript in order to use it for a proper workflow.
That changes now.
This repository is a mirror of the [Archlinux build](https://gitlab.archlinux.org/archlinux/packaging/packages/vim).

## Repository Contents
 
The Root folder contains the Fourth Test of the App and the requirements for it to run.
Install the requirements with the code below while in the Root directory. 

      pip install -r requirements.txt 

This is a python use case so python is a requirement for the app.


##  Deployment

A live version of the project is available [here](https://autodc.streamlit.app/). 

## Additional Notes

This repository is intended to ease the work of data-cleaners. For full details, refer to the documentation.
For any improvements feel free to fork the repo.
